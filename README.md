implementating gRPC from java for multiple project 

### gRPC
In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object, it uses HTTP/2 and Stubs generated from Protocol Buffers for faster and more efficient communication.

* It is easier for you to create distributed applications and services.
* gRPC clients and servers can run and talk to each other in various environments. 
* Client and Server can be developed by using different languages.

 example: we can easily create a gRPC server in Java with clients in Go, Python, or Ruby. 


NOTE: gRPC is a modern and efficient communication protocol that offers several benefits over traditional mechanisms like REST and SOAP. If you need to build a high-performance, scalable, and language-agnostic client-server communication system, gRPC is a great choice.2
